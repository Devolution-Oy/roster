# Roster
[Roster](https://roster.devolution.fi)

Roster is Devolution Oy's tool for track contributor's achievements and details.
The system interacts with Devolution's github projects and "tasker" app.

With the application, contributor can see his/her current account balance and
make requests for new tasks and salaray payments. The contributor can also set
skill labels for his profile, which will be used to assign tasks.

Project administrators can tune the project parameters and create custom payment
records.

Each user can check public project status and project's where he/she is
assigned.
